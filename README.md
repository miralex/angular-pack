# Angular Pack

## Goals

New text

The main goal of this project is to provide an up to date example of Angular application following all recent best practices in various areas like:

- @ngrx/store - including reducers, actions, selectors
- @ngrx/effects - for implementation of side effects like http requests, logging, notifications,...
- @ngrx/entity - for CRUD operations
- @ngrx/router-store - to connect the Angular Router to @ngrx/store
- @ngrx/store-devtools - to enable a powerful time-travelling debugger.
- @angular/material - material design component library, theming, ...
- Routing
- Lazy-loading of feature modules
- Testing of all the above mentioned concepts
- Angular CLI configuration (prod build, budgets, …)
- Responsive design
- Internationalization and localization

#### Continuous Integration

Project is using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for running linters and tests on every commit. Based on your preferences and needs you can either:

- create Travis CI account and link it to your projects Github repo and configure build with GH_REF (github.com/\<username\>/\<repository\>)  and GH_TOKEN (generated in your GitHub account Settings\Personal access tokens) environment variables for automatic deployment of releases to Github Pages

## Project is based on:

- [Angular] - Modern powerful framework
- [Angular Material] - Material design component library
- [Angular Cli] - A command line interface for Angular
- [Bootstrap 4] - Responsive layout from battle tested, world most famous UI library
- [NgRx] - One way data flow powered by RxJS Observables
- [RxJS] - Reactive programming with async collections using Observables
- [Typescript] - Superior developer experience, code completion, refactoring and less bugs
- [I18n] - An internationalization library for Angular


This project is a great match for junior and middle developers who want to familiarize themselves with recent technologies and also can add own simple features and enhance test coverage.
