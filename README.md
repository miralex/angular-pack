# Angular Pack

## Goal

This project like a playground for Angular where you can familiar with code snippets. You can quickly download the project and start to familiar with code and also apply it to your projects.

The main goal of this project is to provide an up to date example of Angular application following all recent best practices in various areas like:

- @ngrx/store - including reducers, actions, selectors
- @ngrx/effects - for implementation of side effects like http requests, logging, notifications,...
- @ngrx/entity - for CRUD operations
- @ngrx/router-store - to connect the Angular Router to @ngrx/store
- @ngrx/store-devtools - to enable a powerful time-travelling debugger.
- @angular/material - material design component library, theming, ...
- Routing
- Lazy-loading of feature modules
- Testing of all the above mentioned concepts
- Angular CLI configuration (prod build, budgets, â€¦ )
- Responsive design
- Internationalization and localization

#### Continuous Integration

Project is using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for running linters and tests on every commit. Based on your preferences and needs you can either:

- create Travis CI account and link it to your projects Github repo and configure build with GH_REF (github.com/\<username\>/\<repository\>)  and GH_TOKEN (generated in your GitHub account Settings\Personal access tokens) environment variables for automatic deployment of releases to Github Pages

## Project is based on:

- [Angular] - Modern powerful framework
- [Angular Material] - Material design component library
- [Angular Cli] - A command line interface for Angular
- [Bootstrap 4] - Responsive layout from battle tested, world most famous UI library
- [NgRx] - One way data flow powered by RxJS Observables
- [RxJS] - Reactive programming with async collections using Observables
- [Typescript] - Superior developer experience, code completion, refactoring and less bugs
- [I18n] - An internationalization library for Angular


This project is a great match for junior and middle developers who want to familiarize themselves with recent technologies and also can add own simple features and enhance test coverage.
